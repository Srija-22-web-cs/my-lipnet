# ðŸŽ¤ LipNet â€“ Deep Learning Lip Reading

**Author:** Srija Lukka  

LipNet is a deep learning model designed to perform **automatic lip reading**. It predicts spoken words from video frames of a speakerâ€™s lips using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). This repository contains a full Jupyter Notebook implementation for training, testing, and experimenting with LipNet.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- Processes sequences of video frames for lip reading.
- Predicts text sequences from mouth movements.
- Easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebook implementation.
- Modular structure for experimentation and research.
